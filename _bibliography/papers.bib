  abstract={We propose a novel second-order optimization framework for training the emerging deep continuous-time models, specifically the Neural Ordinary Differential
Equations (Neural ODEs). Since their training already involves expensive gradient
computation by solving a backward ODE, deriving efficient second-order methods
becomes highly nontrivial. Nevertheless, inspired by the recent Optimal Control
(OC) interpretation of training deep networks, we show that a specific continuoustime OC methodology, called Differential Programming, can be adopted to derive
backward ODEs for higher-order derivatives at the same O(1) memory cost. We
further explore a low-rank representation of the second-order derivatives and show
that it leads to efficient preconditioned updates with the aid of Kronecker-based
factorization. The resulting method converges much faster than first-order baselines
in wall-clock time, and the improvement remains consistent across various applications, e.g. image classification, generative flow, and time-series prediction. Our
framework also enables direct architecture optimization, such as the integration
time of Neural ODEs, with second-order feedback policies, strengthening the OC
perspective as a principled tool of analyzing optimization in deep learning.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
