Hi there, I am a first year PhD in Autonomous Control Decision System (ACDS) Lab at Goeriga Institute of Technology advised by Professor [Evangelos Theodorou](https://ae.gatech.edu/people/evangelos-theodorou).

My research interests are Generative Model, Stochastic Optimal Control, and Large-Scale Optimization.

I am dedicating in improving deep learning models by leveraging celebrated Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC) theory. I am also interested in sloving intracable large-scale problem by utilizing the magic power of deep learning.
